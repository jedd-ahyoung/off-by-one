A few days ago, I was chatting with a developer friend of mine about a project that I've started on GitHub. At the time of this writing, the project isn't very impressive. However, I had decided earlier to make a list of the things that I learned and gained from starting this project. Creating something tangible helped me internalize the accomplishments I'd made in beginning this project.

## Impostor Syndrome

--short thing about impostor syndrome here.--

## The Problems

-- when we  feel this way we're unable to market ourselves - we hold ourselves back
-- feeling shitty about your accomplishments kind of sucks, really
-- you're stressed out because you feel you can't perform/you're not good enough
-- affects you personally and professionally.

We're more likely to see ourselves as impostors when we start to compare ourselves with our community peers. In the development community, we've got a lot of greats - --elaborate here-- from blah, the creator of Ruby, to Crockford, to Rob Eisenberg (the creator of Caliburn Micro, Durandal, and Aurelia), the guys at Google... --end elaboration-- ...the list goes on, and on, and on. Sometimes, though, it's a little closer to home - perhaps you're part of a team that has a specific skillset that you lack, or maybe you're working with that one senior architect who seems to know absolutely everything. (You know the one.)

One step in Bbttling impostor syndrome is internalizing our accomplishments. A great way to do that is to simply enumerate them; by making a concrete list, we not only force honest self-evaluation, we end up with a tangible reminder of how awesome we really are.

## The List

-- Reasons why I'm fucking awesome. Oh yeah.
