How can I maximize my potential? How can I distill the best of what I am and use it effectively?

These are innocuous questions. They're some that we attempt to answer throughout our lives. (At least, I do.) The answer changes as we change, and there are some events in our lives that cause us to question what we know. One of these events happened to me this month; I was given the honor of speaking at Code on the Beach - a developer conference hosted in Jacksonville, and my first conference ever - where I met some people who gave me some words of wisdom (and caused me to revisit these questions.)

This will be a short post - no code, no tech, just introspection. I'll recount three of the lessons I learned, imparted by some of the great people I met at the conference..

## Lead with what you know

I had the privilege of meeting Jeff Fritz at the code conference in Jacksonville. A program manager at Microsoft, Jeff works with the ASP.NET team and he knows his stuff - most of all, he's really passionate about what he does and what he believes in. I was sitting by the resort pool with him, sipping a Hendrix and Tonic, when we discussed saying "I don't know" when speaking on a topic. Now, me - I'm not one to hide what I don't know. I used to be that guy a long time ago, and I've grown out of it; I'll readily admit when I don't know something - but I'll always try to figure it out, or think it over. Essentially, I'd always say "I don't know, but I can figure it out" or "I don't know, but I do know that....", etc. However, Jeff graced me with these words:

> "'I don't know, but I do know....' Don't say that. Never say 'but', because it just inspires doubt. Always lead with what you do know." -Jeff Fritz

Jeff's logic was this - if you don't know, you don't know. And that's okay. Tell people what you do know, because that will inspire confidence - but that single word, "but", can strip all of that away in an instant by creating doubt. In fact, it really might be better to lead with what you do know. Otherwise, you might just be wasting time. I'd never really looked at it this way (and really, I'm still mulling it over) and I think that approaching conversations and problems with this mindset could not only inspire confidence from others, but also confidence in myself.

*Lead with what you know. If you don't know, that's okay, but there's likely a lot that you do know. Use that knowledge to benefit you and the people around you.*

## If you can't prove it, you don't know it

In the same weekend, I got to spend some time with Kathleen Dollard - another Microsoft evangelist. She gave an excellent talk on the relationship between individuals and teams (which I took quite a bit away from) and I really loved hearing her opinions. After the bulk of the conferences were over, and everyone was enjoying the beach, Kathleen shared this with me:

 > "If there's something that you don't know, say that you don't know." -Kathleen Dollard

Naturally, me being the person I am, I said "of course, I always do that" - and promptly, that same night, made a statement in a conversation that I couldn't readily prove. Talk about a foot-in-mouth moment! At this moment, I realized - yeah, I've got quite a few opinions on quite a few things, but if I don't have an example at the ready, I probably shouldn't try to make the argument (whether or not I believe that the argument is correct).

*If you know something, you have to be able to back it up at a moment's notice. Otherwise - you effectively don't know that thing, and thus shouldn't argue it.*

## Breathe, think, speak

Finally - while doing some last-minute practice for my talk at Code on the Beach, I got this gem from a friend of mine - Ashley Grant, an Aurelia core team member. While I was running through my talk, he was giving me advice (essentially, heckling me) and throwing me out of my rhythm completely. This was frustrating, to say the least, but it highlighted a major weakness of mine. We've known each other for a while, and although I'm tempted to discount him, he's a good guy and I trust his judgment as a friend.

 > "Sometimes your mouth keeps running and you get yourself in trouble." -Ashley Grant

This actually brought something to the forefront that I knew, but never really addressed - when I get flustered, I'll speed up and forget to think. That experience (and some others in that weekend) taught me that I'm at my best when I slow down and take my time. Based on some specific past experiences, I was led to believe that this was not a desirable trait, and so I would try to rush a decision or rush a response. Along that path, for me, lies defeat. I've realized that sometimes, it's better to just take a breath - pause - and then renew.

*If you get flustered, just stop for a second. It's okay. Get your bearings and start again.*

## Going Forward

Speaking at Code on the Beach was great - but meeting new people and learning some lessons was the best part of the full experience. I'm hoping to put these lessons to good use in the coming months.
