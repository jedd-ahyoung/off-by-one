"How can you underscore your strengths, overhaul your weaknesses, and maximize your potential?"

Simple phrases - a simple premise. Yet, they're some that we attempt to answer throughout our lives. (At least, I do.) The answer changes as we change, and there are some events in our lives that cause us to question what we know. This month, I was given the honor of speaking at Code on the Beach - a developer conference hosted in Jacksonville, and my first conference ever - where I got to meet some great people with a lot of wisdom to impart. I expected to attend a code conference and give a small talk; I didn't expect Code on the Beach to be an event which would cause me to revisit these questions.

This will be a short post - no code, no tech, just introspection. I'll recount three of the lessons I learned, accompanied by some quotes that have stuck with me.

## Lead with what you know

I had the privilege of meeting Jeff Fritz at the conference. A program manager at Microsoft, Jeff works with the ASP.NET team. The first thing you notice about Jeff is that he really knows his stuff. If I had an hour-long conversation with him about ASP.NET, I'd walk away with knowledge I'd have to sift through for weeks. The second thing you notice is that he's really passionate about what he does and what he believes in; hearing him talk about the things he and his team wanted to accomplish was really inspiring.

I was sitting by the resort pool sipping a Hendrix and Tonic and having a conversation with Jeff about Microsoft technologies. Soon, the conversation turned to some of the previous conference talks, including one about learning to admit ignorance when you know nothing about a specific topic. Now, me - I'm not one to hide what I don't know. I used to be that guy a long time ago, and I've grown out of it; I'll readily admit when I don't know something - but I'll always try to figure it out, or think it over. Essentially, I'd always say "I don't know, but I can figure it out" or "I don't know, but I do know that....", etc. However, Jeff graced me with these words:

 > "'I don't know, but I do know....' Don't say that. Never say 'but', because it just inspires doubt. Always lead with what you do know."

Jeff's logic was this: if you don't know, you don't know. And that's okay. Share what you do know, because doing that will inspire confidence. However, that single word - "but" - can strip all of that away in an instant by creating doubt. As such, it's really better to lead with what you do know. Otherwise, you might just be wasting time. I'd never really looked at it this way (and really, I'm still mulling it over) and I think that approaching conversations and problems with this mindset could not only inspire confidence from others, but also maximize confidence in myself.

*Lead with what you know. If you don't know, that's okay, but there's likely a lot that you do know. Use that knowledge to benefit you and the people around you.*

## If you can't prove it, you don't know it

In the same weekend, I got to spend some time with Kathleen Dollard; she's a .NET expert and developer evangelist. Kathleen was a blast to hang out with - she's got some great opinions, and she's not afraid to share them! She gave an excellent talk on the relationship between individuals and teams (which I took quite a bit away from; if you have time and want to gain a better understanding of interpersonal relationships, look up Transactional Analysis and Psychological Safety on Wikipedia) and I really loved her speaking style as well as her content.

After the bulk of the conferences were over, the conference speakers finally got a bit of beach time on Sunday afternoon. While I was lazing on the beach, I ended up getting some time to chat with Kathleen. She shared this with me:

 > "If there's something that you don't know, just say that you don't know."

Naturally, me being the person I am, I said "of course, I always do that". Promptly, that same night, I ended up in a technical conversation where I made an assertion; the person I was talking to called me out on the assertion, and asked me to prove it by example. At that moment, I realized that I didn't have a handy example - meaning that I couldn't readily prove what I'd just stated! Talk about a foot-in-mouth moment! At this moment, I realized; yeah, I've got quite a few opinions on quite a few subjects - but if I don't have an example at the ready, I probably shouldn't try to make the argument (whether or not I believe that the argument is correct).

*If you know something, you have to be able to back it up at a moment's notice. Otherwise - even if you effectively don't know that thing - you can't argue it, and therefore shouldn't.*

## Breathe, think, speak

Finally, while doing some last-minute practice for my talk at Code on the Beach, I got this gem from a fellow speaker; Ashley Grant, an Aurelia core team member and a good friend of mine. While I was running through my talk, he was critiquing the material, stopping me to give me advice (essentially, heckling me), and throwing me out of my rhythm completely. Naturally, I found this immensely frustrating - and the more I tried to regain my rhythm and balance, the more I fumbled my words. Ashley had this to say:

 > "Sometimes your mouth keeps running and you get yourself in trouble."

Ashley and I have known each other for a while, and although I'm tempted to rag on him, he's a good friend and his judgment was sound. This actually brought something to the forefront that I knew, but never really addressed - when I get flustered, I'll fumble and forget to take time to think. Based on some specific past experiences, I was led to believe that needing time to ruminate was not a good thing - better to think and talk quickly - and so I would try to rush a decision or rush a response. This experience (and some others in that weekend) highlighted a major weakness of mine, and taught me that I'm really at my best when I slow down and take my time.

*If you get flustered, it's okay. Just stop for a second. Take a breath, get your bearings, and start again.*

## Going Forward

Speaking at Code on the Beach was great - but meeting new people and learning some valuable lessons was the best part of the full experience. I'm hoping to put these lessons to good use in the coming months, and I'm glad that I could share my experiences.

I've shared - now, how about you? Anyone have any good lessons that they've learned lately? Share your introspection!
